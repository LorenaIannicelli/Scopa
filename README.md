# Scopa

This is a website to play the Italian card game: Scopa! 

The main page features facts about the game, as well as an explanation of the cards and rules.

Navigate to the left to play the game against a computer. 

On the right, you can check out your user profile: update your profile picture and see your stats. Play more games to increase your stats!

I hope you have fun! This is one of my favorite games (it gets pretty heated in real life :) )
